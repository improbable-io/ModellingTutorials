    "\n",
    "* the friction between the ball and the table as it rolls\n",
    "* air resistance on the ball\n",
    "* if the ball has backspin: the friction of the ball as it skids along the table\n",
    "\n",
    "The study by <a href=\"WittersDuymelinck86.pdf\">Witters and Duymelinck (1986)</a> shows that we can neglect air resistance at the speeds we're concered about. It also shows that the ball is unlikely to have any backspin at this speed, so we make the modelling assumption that the ball is rolling along the table with no backspin. So, we are left with just the friction between the ball and the table, which the paper shows exerts a decelleration force that is proportional to the force of the ball on the table due to gravity. If we let $\\alpha$ be the constant of proportionality then the frictional force $F = \\alpha mg$.\n",
